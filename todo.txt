3 goals:
xxMake linrel.xml work and see how it performs compared to wireframe.xml
xxWrite the code that truncates text if it's too long, so it doesn't fuck up the results list
--Do the wireframe for the "read more" function from longpressing results

!--How to truncate the text--

Well, first see if you can feasibly get the size of the string, multiply it by the size of the font, and boom you have the size of the text. 

Subtract the text size from the max width

if > 0, Divide the difference by size of font

The quotient is the number of letters to remove. Round up.
