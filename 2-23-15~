TODO TODAY:
**Add the More Info panel functionality
--Decide the purpose/design intent of the home screen
--Draw the wireframe for the home screen

Roadblocks:
--Spending too much time making small changes with no ultimate purpose
--Spending too much time googling because I don't know exactly how to implement this panel
--Getting distracted/feeling tired

==Idea: First design the xml for the dialogue box, then worry about the code to implement it.

TOMORROW/Later:
--Implement the home page
--Decide intent/purpose of Deck info page
--Design wireframe for deck info
